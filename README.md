# HSCAProjectS22
This repository has elements for the Spring 2022 High-Speed Computer
Arithmetic Class.  It has the project files for the binary16
754-compliant fma design in SystemVerilog.

Note: Please build the TestFloat/SoftFloat libraries before you begin.
      You can use the scripts build_me.sh to build things.  I have
      clean_me.sh in the repository if you want to delete items as it
      does create a large repository (e.g., if you wanted to have your
      own forked repository).
